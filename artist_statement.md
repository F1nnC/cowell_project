For my entire life, I have been surrounded by technology and have been absolutely fascinated by it. I knew ever since I was a kid that my job was going to be about computers because they genuinely give me joy. As I have learned more about technology, I began to realize the large harmful effects caused by the industry. Whether that's through polluting the atmosphere through the use of fossil fuels for energy, or it's the exploitative labor practices to assemble the technology we use, there are always ethical quandaries when it surrounds tech. Which left me with of a sense of doubt, because on one hand I enjoy this field and believe that it changes people’s lives. However, the practices shown by these large companies don’t tend to be eco-friendly or humane. I feel responsible going forward to pursue this field in an ethical way that benefits all people, and I wanted to illustrate that fact using my project.

For this project, I chose to create a game because I wanted to show the cause-and-effect relationship between technological advancement and environmental harm in a clear and simple way. I have made a lot of small mini-games for programming classes, so presenting my idea in this format felt natural to me. The game puts the player in the position of someone making decisions about their own AI, and I think it does a strong job of showing how little regulation really exists. Since AI is considered a matter of national security, the government is often unwilling to slow its development, even when there are consequences. Because of that, the responsibility ultimately falls on the people building and funding these systems to make ethical choices. That responsibility is what I wanted to highlight through this project.
